      "Today, I visited the prominent model train store, Kato Hobby Center Tokyo, located in Tokyo. It's just a 5-minute walk from Exit A1 of Ochiai-Minami-Nagasaki Station on the Toei Oedo Line. As a railway model enthusiast, you may already be familiar with this place, but it's worth noting that admission is free, and you can also enjoy viewing the large dioramas for free as well.",
